# Pricemate

## Description
![](pricemate.png)
Pricemate has two components:
1. A scraper that can be called from the command line
2. A web app with simple visualization

The scraper provides helper functions to scrape train ticket listings from Tiket.com, optionally sort them by departure time. 

The web app shows a simple visualization (with tooltips) of the ticket prices over time, and a simple table of all the train listings.
